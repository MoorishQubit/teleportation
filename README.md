# Long distance entanglement and high-dimensional quantum teleportation in the Fermi–Hubbard model

Sanaa Abaach, Zakaria Mzaouali, and Morad El Baz

This repository is dedicated to the research on [Long distance entanglement and high-dimensional quantum teleportation in the Fermi–Hubbard model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-28180-4). The primary focus is on the peculiarities of the Fermi-Hubbard model's ground state and its capability to sustain maximum long-distance entanglement, thus functioning as a quantum resource for high fidelity quantum teleportation over long distances.

# Keywords
